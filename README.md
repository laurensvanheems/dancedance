# DANCEDANCE
Small WIP game to experiment with websockets based on Dance Dance Revolution. Let's users create a private room and connect with another device. One player decides the rhythm and the symbols which appear on the other player's screen. The other player scores point by matching the symbols in the right rhytm.
